Hello Mr. Karl. 
I have no clue why but opening my index.html from my file explorer makes me chrome browser to block my API fetches. I searched up a lot of fixes but it works when you run my index.html using npx serve. it will create a local host port number in which yu can ctrl + click to load into the browser. 

Sorry for the inconvenience, I hope this does not drop my grade.
